To do:

1. Sift through data using python. Each cell should be a item in a list. 
2. Find a way to bin each record of taxi rides to a specific place in NYC
	Bin types:	uptown/midtown/downtown
			neighborhoods
			upper east/upper west/lower west/lower east/etc...
			longitudinal/latitudinal bins (just based on long/lat)
3. Generate a table based on this information, i.e. 
	Start location/end location - bins
	Price - price
	etc...
4. Build a graph based on the table
	Graph type: correlations, something else, something else...
