        Overarching To do:

        1. Sift through data using python. Each cell should be a item in a list. 
        2. Find a way to bin each record of taxi rides to a specific place in NYC
        	Bin types:	uptown/midtown/downtown
        			neighborhoods
	        		upper east/upper west/lower west/lower east/etc...
		        	longitudinal/latitudinal bins (just based on long/lat)
        3. Generate a table based on this information, i.e.     
        	Start location/end location - bins
        	Price - price
        	etc...
        4. Build a graph based on the table
        	Graph type: correlations, something else, something else...

	Alternatives:
	A) Examine tip data to find highest and lowest tipped areas of manhattan/NY

Usage: python finalpass.py
`* Necessary to have the rawoutput.csv generated by buildraw.py
Output: neighborhoods_ref.txt which holds a list of neighborhoods and their indices
	binoutput.csv which holds index,index,fare
